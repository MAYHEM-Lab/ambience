= Î¼Bench

`ubench` is a benchmarking library designed to be used on
freestanding environments.

== Usage

=== Writing benchmarks

ubench follows the google benchmark syntax almost verbatim:

[source,cpp]
----
namespace bench = tos::bench;
void BM_ContextSwitch(bench::any_state& state) {
    for (auto _ : state) {
        tos::this_thread::yield();
    }
}
BENCHMARK(BM_ContextSwitch);
----

The code you wish to benchmark goes into the body of the for loop.
ubench will run the loop as long as it needs to reach statistical
stability.

You can set up stuff that shouldn't be benchmarked before the loop:

[source,cpp]
----
void BM_VectorPushBack(bench::any_state& state) {
    std::vector<int> x;
    for (auto _ : state) {
        x.push_back(42);
    }
}
----

=== Running benchmarks

You'll need to acquire a clock to be able to run benchmarks. Once
you have a clock, it's straightforward to run the benchmarks:

[source,cpp]
----
void bench_main(tos::any_usart& usart) {
    auto tim = tos::open(tos::devs::timer<0>);
    tos::clock clock(&tim);
    auto erased_clock = tos::erase_clock(&clock);

    tos::bench::bench bechmark(&erased_clock);

    auto run = [&](auto& name, auto& fn) {
        auto [dur, iters, sums, squares] = bechmark.do_benchmark(fn);
        tos::println(usart, name, ":", dur.count(), iters, sums, squares);
    };

    tos::bench::run_global_benchmarks(run);
}
