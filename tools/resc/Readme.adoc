= tos Resource Compiler

`resc` is a utility that let's programs package data in the binaries that are accessible as a static {cpp} class.

Resources are defined with `yaml` files such as this one:

[source,yaml]
----
resources:
  - name: boot_message
    type: string
    value: Hello world!
----

When compiled with `resc`, the `boot_message` is available as a `std::string_view` in {cpp}:

[source,cpp]
----
LOG(resources::boot_message());
----

The generated code is completely static and any unused resource will get stripped
away by the linker.

== Embedding a binary file

Binary files can easily be embedded through the resource compiler:

[source, yaml]
----
resources:
  - name: some_binary
    type: blob
    value:
      from_file: some_binary.bin
----

`some_binary` will be available as a `tos::span<const uint8_t>`.
