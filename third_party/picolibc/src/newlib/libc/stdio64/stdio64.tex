@chapter Large File Input and Output (@file{stdio.h}) 

This chapter comprises additional functions to manage large files which
are potentially larger than 2GB.

The underlying facilities for input and output depend on the host
system, but these functions provide a uniform interface.

The corresponding declarations are in @file{stdio.h}.

@menu
* fdopen64::    Turn open large file into a stream
* fopen64::     Open a large file
* freopen64::   Open a large file using an existing file descriptor
* fsetpos64::   Restore position of a large stream or file
* fgetpos64::   Get position of a large stream or file
* ftello64::    Return position in a large stream or file
* fseeko64::    Set large file position
* tmpfile64::   Create a temporary large file
@end menu
