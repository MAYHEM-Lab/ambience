FUNCTION
	<<freelocale>>---free resources allocated for a locale object

INDEX
	freelocale

INDEX
	_freelocale_r

SYNOPSIS
	#include <locale.h>
	locale_t freelocale(locale_t <[locobj]>);

	locale_t _freelocale_r(void *<[reent]>, locale_t <[locobj]>);

DESCRIPTION
The <<freelocale>> function shall cause the resources allocated for a
locale object returned by a call to the <<newlocale>> or <<duplocale>>
functions to be released.

The behavior is undefined if the <[locobj]> argument is the special locale
object LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE or is not a valid locale object handle.

Any use of a locale object that has been freed results in undefined
behavior.

RETURNS
None.

PORTABILITY
<<freelocale>> is POSIX-1.2008.
