= BearSSL

This is BearSSL, but built with CMake to make integration easy.

The original readme is in `README.original.txt` in the root of the repo.

## Include in your project

Get the sources to your repo somehow (subtree, submodule, plain copy etc.)

Add the following to your project:

----
add_subdirectory(path/to/this/repo)
----

Then just link it to other targets:

----
target_link_libraries(your_target PUBLIC BearSSL::BearSSL)
----

That's it!

## Build standalone

----
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G Ninja ..
ninja
----

The `brssl` tool will be in `tools/brssl`, samples in `samples/` and tests in `test/`.
