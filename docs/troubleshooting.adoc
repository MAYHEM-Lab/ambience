#### `io_tests` is segfaulting

You are probably in a Debug build on Clang.

Unfortunately, the `scheduler::start` function must be optimized for
tos threading to work.

On GNU, we use `[[gnu::optimize("Os")]]` on that function to ensure
optimizations even in Debug builds so it's not an issue.

However, clang doesn't appear to have a corresponding attribute yet,
so do not run tests of Clang's Debug binaries.

CAUTION: Clang Debug binaries are unstable with multiple
threads, so should be avoided. Use MinSizeRel with Clang.

This will be resolved when we switch to our own libc.
