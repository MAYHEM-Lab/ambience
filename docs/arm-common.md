# Getting Started on ARM

## Install OpenOCD

See general/openocd.adoc for details.

## Install the toolchain

https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads

Download it and extract it somewhere (preferably /opt/x-tools/)

## Update the toolchain file

The path to the toolchain should be placed in cmake/ArmToolchain.cmake
