# nRF52840

## Supported features/drivers:

+ GPIO
+ USART (DMA)
+ SPI (DMA)
+ I2C (DMA)
+ TIMER
+ Radio (somewhat)
+ BLE over SoftDevice (peripheral)

## Notes

+ DMA based drivers don't support passing buffers that aren't in the RAM.
+ While the SoftDevice is active, debugging crashes the chip. So don't.
+ Some peripherals share the same ID and can't even be linked at the same time
