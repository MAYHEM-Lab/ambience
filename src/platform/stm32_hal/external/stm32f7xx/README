Patch List:

   *Fix LL_EXTI_LINE_18 and LL_EXTI_LINE_20 declarations
     LL_EXTI_LINE_18 and LL_EXTI_LINE_20 are declared in stm32f7xx_hal_pcd.h
     and in stm32f7xx_ll_exti.h which generates warnings. Set #ifndef
     in stm32f7xx_ll_exti.h around declarations.
    Impacted files:
     drivers/include/stm32f7xx_ll_exti.h
    ST Bug tracker ID: 55274

    *Use of (__packed uint32_t *) produces warning
      Using GNU 8.2.0, (__packed uint32_t *) generates warning.
      Replace with CMSIS macros __UNALIGNED_UINT32_READ and
      __UNALIGNED_UINT32_WRITE.
     Impacted files:
      drivers/include/stm32f7xx_ll_usb.c
     ST Bug tracker ID: 61327

    *Fix warnings for extraneous parentheses
      Using clang 7.0.1, if ((htim->State == HAL_TIM_STATE_BUSY))
      generates warnings.  Remove the extra parentheses
