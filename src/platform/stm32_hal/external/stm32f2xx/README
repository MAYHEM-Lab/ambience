Status:
   version 1.7.0

Purpose:
   ST Microelectronics official MCU package for STM32F2 series.

Description:
   This package is an extract of official STM32CubeF2 package written by ST Microelectronics.
   It is composed of STM32Cube hardware abstraction layer (HAL) and low layer (LL) plus a set
   of CMSIS headers files, one for each SoC in STM32F2 series.

Dependencies:
    None.

Patch List:

   *Disable i2c HAL
     Due to conflict with zephyr i2c.h (I2C_SPEED_STANDARD and I2C_SPEED_FAST
     redefinition), deactivate STM32Cube I2C HAL. This raises no issue since
     LL API is currently used for stm32 I2C driver.
    Impacted files:
     drivers/include/stm32f2xx_hal_conf.h
    ST Bug tracker ID: NA. Not a stm32cube issue

   *Fix VBUS sensing deactivation
     The error is detected if USART1 TX configured to PA9 and RX to PA10.
     The serial cable removal stops the USB communication.
     In case of VBUS sensing deactivation, erroneously
     both USB_OTG_GCCFG_VBUSBSEN and USB_OTG_GCCFG_NOVBUSSENS are set in GCCFG.
     Correct handling is:
      - VBUS sensing deactivation: set USB_OTG_GCCFG_NOVBUSSENS in GCCFG.
      - VBUS sensing activation:   set USB_OTG_GCCFG_VBUSBSEN in GCCFG.
    Impacted files:
     ext/hal/st/stm32cube/stm32f2xx/drivers/src/stm32f2xx_ll_usb.c
    ST Bug Tracker ID: 34714

    *Use of (__packed uint32_t *) produces warning
      Using GNU 8.2.0, (__packed uint32_t *) generates warning.
      Replace with CMSIS macros __UNALIGNED_UINT32_READ and
      __UNALIGNED_UINT32_WRITE.
     Impacted files:
      drivers/include/stm32f2xx_ll_usb.c
     ST Bug tracker ID: 61324

    *Fix warnings for extraneous parentheses
      Using clang 7.0.1, if ((htim->State == HAL_TIM_STATE_BUSY))
      generates warnings.  Remove the extra parentheses
